# blue-calculator
A calculator for those that like blue. Something I am working on to practice my coding skills.

I finished the html and css but could not get the javascript to work. When the buttons were clicked nothing would happen ,even though I had used a event listener to listen for clicks and take the appropriate action based on the button clicked. When I loaded it in the browser the console would show a error ,somthing about addEventListener(...) not being a function. I gave up on this project for a while. Today ,after learning imba for the last couple of days from the course on Scrimba, I decided to redo this project using Imba, both to practice Imba and salvage this project.
